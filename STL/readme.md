Parts of STL:

1) Containers : Data structures that are pre-implemented in STL
2) Iterators : Pointers to elements in the container
3) Algorithms: Common Algorithms with the best optimized code
4) Functors: Classes which acts as functions ( Very Rarely needed )


*Types of STL containers*:

1) Sequential : That are Sequentially implemented (like Array)
  - Vectors
  - Stack
  - Queue 
  - Pair ( Not a Container)



2) Ordered : Values are stored in some sorted order
 - Map
 - Multimap
 - Set
 - MultiSet


3) Unordered : Based on hashing algorithms
  - Unordered map
  - Unordered set
